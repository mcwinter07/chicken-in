We had five formal mettings with our client:

1. Thursday, 5th July: This was our first formal meeting with Ed. We met to discuss the web-app's requirements, including core functionality and styling requirements. Ed gave us an overview of how he wanted the app to work, including having the ability to:
- Approve or reject shift submissions
- View a summary of all the shifts by week
- Automatically calculate the pay based on the hours worked and day worked
- Add or remove employees from the system

  We also proposed some ideas, including developing for mobile first, and creating a user-friendly interface for his employees. We went back-and-forth discussing these requirements for about an hour. At that point, we decided we had enough information to develop a basic wireframe so we ended the metting and arranged to meet early next week to discuss our draft wireframe.

2. Tuesday 10th July: We met for approximately 30 minutes to discuss the draft wireframe that we had put together. The wireframe included all the core functionality that we discussed the previous week, but did not have all the styling completed. After some discussion, Ed was happy with the functionality we proposed and didn't ask for any major changes. We ended the meeting and arranged to meet again after the wireframes were fully styled.

3. Friday, 13th July: We met for about 20 minutes to discuss the fully styled wireframes. Ed didn't have any preference for the styling or branding, so this was his first time seeing what we had in mind for styling. He liked the logo and color scheme so didn't propose any major styling changes. Now that he could visualize the final app, he was quite excited about it.

4. Friday, 20th July: We met for an hour to show Ed the progress we had made. We had built the functionlaity for most of the pages, but a lot of the styling work still needed to be done. Ed was a little concerend that there wasn't enough time to finish the app, so he proposed to reduce some of the functionality. We tried to assure him that eventhough it looked rough, a lot of the functionality had already been done and that we would have enough time to finish the whole thing. Ed tested some of the functionality and made some recommendations about how the filtering and sorting should work. We agreed to change to functionality to align with what he wanted.

5. Wednesday, 25th July: By this stage, we had finished 95% of the app's functionality and styling. We met with Ed to show him the app, and he was impressed with what we had done. We walked him through various aspects of the app, and he tested out some of the functionality as we went along. He was happy with how everything worked, and was glad that it worked on his mobile phone. Afterwards, we discussed next steps, indlucing deployment, data and ongoing maintenence. Ed told us he would continue to maintain the app with the help of his nephew, who is a web developer. We told him we would hand over our project to him on Friday, after we finished our presentation.
