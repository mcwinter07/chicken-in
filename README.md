## **Information Gathering and Competitior Analysis**

When tackling this opportunity, our team wanted to develop a lightweight shift tracking app, that merged user centric design with the MERN for intuative communication between the front and backend codebase.

<br>

#### **Competitor Analysis**

While a competitive marketplace, we found that a disproportionate number of employee and shift management services offered online are built ontop of models with a high barrier of entry for small to medium sized businesses, such as our clients.

In addition to varying financial costs, users are forced to make the choice between larger companies, which can offer customisation, and smaller companies, which while leaner and easier to use, lack the ability to be tailored to their business.

<br>

#### **Color Development**

When picking colours, our aim was to use contrast to our advantage to direct the user's attention towards import buttons and visually guide them through in-app processes.

# Application Design 

## **The Client Brief**


The client for this project, owns and operates a number of charcoal chicken shops around Victoria, under the brand name “Red Rocks Charcoal Chicken”. He splits majority of his time between working in the stores as a manager and performing the administrative/entrepreneurial activities as the owner.

#### **The Problem**

One of our client's most significant challenges is keeping track of employee hours worked, calculating overtime and calculating how much he owes in wages to each employee. Currently, his employees record how many hours they’ve worked on a paper form, and he manually updates his excel spreadsheet at the end of the week. It’s time-consuming work, and his employees often make mistakes which means he has to follow up with each employee if there are any discrepancies in the shifts they've logged.

#### **The Solution**

Our original proposal was an overtime calculator - a small app that would help the client track of weekly hours worked by his staff, and automatically calculate the number of overtime hours. This concept grew to include both a manager and employee logins, to enable real-time tracking and input of total hours, dates and overtime rates with every shift.

#### **Employee Functionality**

Addressing a key consideration from our client, we decided to implement a mobile-first approach for the employee facing app, where each user is able to log in, enter, track, and view the total standard/overtime/double time hours of each shift input. 

We found that this stripped back interface would best serve the needs of the client's team, who found their paper-based system inefficient and time-consuming.

#### **Manager Functionality**

On successful manager login, the user is redirected to the manager dashboard, where they have access to several core functions of the app.

Managers will be able to view weekly shift reports, approve or reject pending shifts, manage their teams stores and configure their business settings.

After our initial meeting with the client, our team decided that we could not integrate mobile-first design for the manager dashboard without sacrificing the ability to display and easily read shift data. As such, the manager dashboard focused on desktop functionality, with mobile-driven design benched as a stretch goal.

<br>

## **Concept Review** {x}

Review the conceptual design with the client and edit based on their feedback

## **User Stories**

We focussed on providing a number of basic user profiles based on the types of users we are likely to encounter. Using Trello, we populated a number of users, with common wants and insights gain from our meetings with the client:

<br>

## **Wireframes and UX**

To create our intial wireframe we used the insights gained through our user stories to rapidly prototype our apps features and general design. From there, we moved on to more specific design wireframes, which can be seen below:

<br>


#### **Guest Pages**

We decided to implement a mobile-first design for our guest and employee login pages as they would be the most frequent users of the Chicken-in Web app. The single page design allows the users to rapidly digest the purpose of the app with a summary of its full functionality in the about section.

<a href="./docs/part-b/images/guest-loginPage.png" target="_blank"><img src="./docs/part-b/images/guest-loginPage.png" width="800"></a>

<br>

#### **Employee View**

Iterating on the single page design, Red Rocks employees are redirected to a lightweight rostering app with the immediate ability to add and review past/pending/rejected shifts.

<a href="./docs/part-b/images/employee-pages.png" target="_blank"><img src="./docs/part-b/images/employee-pages.png" width="800"></a>

<br>

#### **Manager Reports**

On this page, the manager is given an overview of the weekly shifts that have been approved or are pending approval. A stretch goal is to integrate a "print report" function that produces a print ready pdf for physical documentation. An additional consideration is to include data visualisation within this dashboard further support the reporting functionality.

<a href="./docs/part-b/images/manager-reports.png" target="_blank"><img src="./docs/part-b/images/manager-reports.png" width="800"></a>

<br>

#### **Manager Approvals**

On this page, managers have the ability to view all pending shifts input from employees and approve/reject them. Stretch goals are to include a comment popup when rejecting a shift to give further clarification to an employee as to why the shift has been denied.

<a href="./docs/part-b/images/manager-approvals.png" target="_blank"><img src="./docs/part-b/images/manager-approvals.png" width="800"></a>

<br>

#### **Manager Team Management**

We decided that a full-scale HR app that stored and protected large amounts of employee data was not necessary for our client scale. Designed for ease of use, we kept the interface lean, with the ability to quickly edit, remove (archive), and add new employees within one view.

<a href="./docs/part-b/images/manager-teamManagement-newEmp.png" target="_blank"><img src="./docs/part-b/images/manager-teamManagement-newEmp.png" width="800"></a>

<br>

#### **Manager Settings**

Rather than hard code the values for overtime and double time, we decided to give our client the option to change the multiplier according to the current award rate in hospitality, as this is prone to change.

## **Planning and Implementation**

To ensure we stayed on track, our team implemented a series of system, from agile methodologies to project management apps, to ensure we kept to our project timeline. 

Initial Projections had the core planning stages to be completed within the first week and second week would be attributed to the brunt of the codebase.

In conjunction with Trello, we also utilised timeline app create by one of our own <a href="https://github.com/maxitron93/">team</a> for our initial build. Below you can see the main legs for our stages of development.

## Project Management Tools

Given the scope and scale of the project, our team was cognizant of the need to track and monitor our progress with each stage of development. To best support the team dynamic and ensure continual development we used the following tools:

<br>

#### **Figma** 
For developing the wireframes. We had a two-stage design process- An initial group-planned mock wireframe, and then more fleshed-out "design" wireframes.

<a href="./docs/part-b/images/figma_snap.png" target="_blank"><img src="./docs/part-b/images/figma_snap.png" width="800"></a>


#### **Trello** 
For general project management. We leaned *heavily* on this! We've multiple boards for resources and internal info, but it all flows back to our main trello board (example below).


<a href="./docs/part-b/images/trello_snap.png" target="_blank"><img src="./docs/part-b/images/trello_snap.png" width="800"></a>

<a href="https://trello.com/b/DFlgggpu/scrum-board" target="_blank">Scrum</a> board.

#### **Git** 
For version control. See below for more detail about our Git workflow.

<a href="./docs/part-b/images/gitlog_snap.png" target="_blank"><img src="./docs/part-b/images/gitlog_snap.png" width="800"></a>

<br>

## GitFlow

For version and source control, we will be using Git, with a main repository stored on Github. At this early stage we’ve planned to use a “Protected” `master` branch for pushing to production, and a `develop` development branch for working between releases. 

We have taken a lot of inspiration from this model: https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ 

Master (Protected): The `master` branch is ‘Protected’ against any `git push` commands, and only able to be merged via Pull Request on Github. The idea behind this is that `master` is only to be used for stable releases that have been tested and checked thoroughly.

For individual features, Our plan is to use separate `feature` branches cloned off of the `develop` branch. These branches will be merged into the `develop` branch, after changes are pulled and conflicts resolved. We intend to push these `feature` branches as well, to keep a record of our progress, though this isn’t really necessary for a project of this scale.

<a href="./docs/part-b/images/git-workflow.png" target="_blank"><img src="./docs/part-b/images/git-workflow.png" width="800"></a>

<br>

## Agile First

From the outset of this project, we decided to take a lot from the Agile methodology. Given that each of us has our own unique strengths, we have embraced the idea that we will be far more powerful as a team, and the Agile (Specifically, Scrum) practices offer a lot in the way of organization.

<br>

## Code review

Our process was handled largely through Trello, with each completed being sent to our "Pending Review" list prior to deployment. 

If a feature/page/branch encountered an error that could not be immediately fixed, a member of our team would place it in the "Blocked" column. This signalled for one or more team members to jump on the issue and try to find a solution.

We used annotations and `TODO:` lists in code to identify problem areas or necessary fixes.
